MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for 
M2M (machine to machine) telemetry in low bandwidth environments.

It was designed by Andy Stanford-Clark (IBM) and Arlen Nipper in 1999 for 
connecting Oil Pipeline telemetry systems over satellite.
MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport but previously was known as 
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport.
MQTT is fast becoming one of the main protocols for IOT (internet of things) deployments.


How Does MQTT Work ? 

MQTT is a messaging protocol i.e it was designed for transferring messages, 
and uses a publish and subscribe model.

This model makes it possible to send messages to 0,1 or multiple clients.

In MQTT a publisher publishes messages on a topic and a subscriber must subscribe 
to that topic to view the message.

MQTT requires the use of a central Broker

Important Points to Note

   1.Clients do not have addresses like in email systems, and messages are not sent to clients.
   2.Messages are published to a broker on a topic.
   3.The job of an MQTT broker is to filter messages based on topic, and then distribute 
      them to subscribers.
   4.A client can receive these messages by subscribing to that topic on the same broker
   5.There is no direct connection between a publisher and subscriber.
   6.All clients can publish (broadcast) and subscribe (receive).
   7.MQTT brokers do not normally store messages.
