Pre-requisite:

NOTE:  we required 2 RB-A5D2x boards. and  boot the  board with sd card image only.

* CAN protocols settings are required on both boards*

1. on 1st-Board

          ip link set can0 down
          ip link set can0 type can bitrate 50000 
          ip link set can0 up


2. on 2nd-Board

          ip link set can0 down
          ip link set can0 type can bitrate 50000 
          ip link set can0 up

3. Set the Cross-compilation setup

    . /opt/poky-tiny/2.5.2/environment-setup-cortexa5hf-neon-poky-linux-musleabi

3. Compilation the Application
      
     ${CC} cansender.c -o cansender
     ${CC} canreceiver.c -o canreceiver
    
4. Execution

    1. on 1st-Board
       ./cansender

    1. on 2nd-Board
       ./canreceiver

 
   Result: 
           On canreciver side..
        
  	  can_id  = 0x123;
	  can_dlc = 2;
	  data[0] = 0x11;
	  data[1] = 0x22;
