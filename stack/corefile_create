Create normal dump files
One of the big mysteries with Linux systems is where the core dumps are located. Linux has a trick in place to capture core dumps. This particular setting is done via the sysctl kernel.core_pattern setting or /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern. Most systems will have a pipe (|) in this setting to indicate that a program needs to take care of the generated data. So if you wonder where your core dump goes, follow the pipe!

Core dumps on Ubuntu systems are typically going to Apport. For Red Hat based systems it may be redirected to Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT).

You can temporarily change this setting, by echoing “core” to that file, or use the sysctl utility.

sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=core

An important note is that this change might not be enough. It depends also on your fs.suid_dumpable setting. A warning will be logged to your kernel logger if that is the case.

When needed set your core_pattern to a full path, optionally with variables defining who was running it, the PID, etc.

sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/var/crash/core.%u.%e.%p
